- What does `null` mean in JavaScript?<br>
  `null` means "nothing" in Javascript. Null is an object, and null usually results from human interactions, such as intentionally assigning an empty value to a variable for later use. Undefined, on the other hand, usually results from the system when the JS function does not have 'return' value, or when sth wrong and JS cannot calculate the value, or when there is no initialization upon a declared variable (nothing has been defined there). Null is the definition of emptiness and undefined is no-definition.
