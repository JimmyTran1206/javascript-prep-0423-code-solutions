## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What data type is returned by an arithmetic operation? <br>
  arithmetic operation should return number
- What is string concatenation?<br>
  string concatenation merges two or more strings into one. Javascript will try to convert other data type to string before merging.
- What purpose(s) does the `+` plus operator serve in JavaScript?<br>
  The plus `+` operator perform addition in arithmetic operations, if all the data types involved in the operation are number. If there are strings in the operation, the plus `+` operator performs string concatenation. Javascript will evaluate the operation from left to right.
- What data type is returned by comparing two values (`<`, `>`, `===`, etc)?
  Comparison operations should return values with Boolean data type (`true`/`false`)
- What does the `+=` "plus-equals" operator do?<br>
  This is a short form of self-assignment, for example, x+=y is equivalent to x=x+y <br>
  In arithmetic operation, the `+=` increases the value of the numeric variable involved on the left side by a certain amount specified on the right side. <br>
  In concatenation operation, the `+=` appends the string on the right side to the end of the string involved on the left side.
