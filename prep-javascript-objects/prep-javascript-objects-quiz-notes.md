## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What data types can object properties hold?<br>
  Based on the examples so far and based on my readings, object properties can hold primitive types, such as number, string, boolean, undefined, symbol, null. I saw examples of object property holding another object with specified properties as well. I think that the object property can also hold the array as well. Uhm, look like it can hold many data types.

- Describe the syntax (structure) of object-literals in JavaScript.<br>
  Object-literals in javascripts can be defined by `const`, following by `objectName` and assignment `=` with curly braces `{}`. Inside the curly braces `{}`, the `properties` and `methods` of the object are defined (or declared and left undefined).
